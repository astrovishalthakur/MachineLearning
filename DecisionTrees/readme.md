### A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.

### A decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top. In the image on the left, the bold text in black represents a condition/internal node, based on which the tree splits into branches/ edges. The end of the branch that doesnâ€™t split anymore is the decision/leaf

### In this procedure all the features are considered and different split points are tried and tested using a cost function. The split with the best cost (or lowest cost) is selected.
