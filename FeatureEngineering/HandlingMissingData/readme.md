# Here I show different techniques to handle missing data.

### 1. Complete case Analysis
Complete case anaylsis(CCA), also called "list-wise deletion" of cases, consists in discarding obsercations where vlaues in any of the variables are missing.
Complete Case Analysis means literally analyzing only those observations for which there is information in all of the variabels in the dataset.

### 2. Mean Median Value Imputation
It is used on numerical data, where we fill the missing data with mean or median of available data.

### 3. Arbitrary Value Imputation
Here we fill the missing values with arbitrary values.
