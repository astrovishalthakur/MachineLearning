# Outliers Detection and Handling

## Here I have discussed some techniques to detect and handle outliers on different kind of datasets.
## In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

### 2. Outlier Detection using IQR.
### 3. Outlier Detection using Percentiles.
