# Handling Categorical Data.

### Machines only understand numbers (and only 0 and 1 at that) but real world data can be scary.
#### Real world data have numerical as well as non numerical values. 
#### It's our responsibility as a machine learning engineer to handle this data.
### Following folder consists of notebooks explaining various techniques to handle categorical data.

# I have created notebooks to explain following techinques:
1. Ordinal Encoding. (ordinal Encoder and label encoder)
2. Nominal Encoding (onehotencoding).
