# Here I will show how to import dataset to google colab from kaggle.

#### As we all know colab from google is an excellent choice to run heavy models if we don't have highend GPU or CPU in our pc.
#### Since some kaggle datasets could be very large to first download and then upload on colab and it also gets deleted if runtime gets disconnected.
#### To save us from hassle of reuploading datasets, we can ask google colab to import it directly from kaggle.
## No worries now.
#### Follow the commands in above notebook and you can easily import the dataset of your choice to kaggle.
#### And if runtime gets disconnected, you just need to rerun the commands.
